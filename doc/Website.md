## Overview

Welcome to the **PingPong Client Website** documentation. This website is designed as the user interface for accessing and viewing data fetched from the server. The site is built using:

- **Vue.js** for dynamic web components
- **Tailwind CSS** for modern, responsive styling
- **CSS** for additional custom styling

## Setup

cd PingPong/Client
```

### Install Dependencies

```

### Run the Development Server

```

You can then access the website at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

## Configuration

### API Endpoint

Update the API endpoint in the Vue.js configuration to match your server's address. This configuration can typically be found in a configuration file or set through environment variables.

### Styling

Customize the appearance of your website by editing the CSS files and adjusting Tailwind CSS configuration as needed.

## Usage
